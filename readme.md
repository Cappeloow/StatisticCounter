##StatisticCounter

#The purpose of this application

- Visitor Tracking: Count and record the number of visitors and the nature of their assistance requests, such as guidance, information, tourism-related inquiries, and more.

- Comprehensive Display: Present a separate page that displays the cumulative statistics of different types of visitor assistance. This includes the total count of each assistance category, allowing for a quick overview of the overall service provided.

- Time Slot Tracking: Implement a feature to log the timing and duration of customer service interactions using time slots. The application will categorize the service interactions into specific time intervals, such as 8:00-9:00, 10:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00, and so on. This functionality enables precise tracking and analysis of service trends over time, including the specific time slots during which services were rendered.

- User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use, particularly for new employees. This approach enhances their onboarding experience and contributes to overall time efficiency.

# Thoughts

- I want to get my Array of "matters" to the statisticPanel, there i want to to display them one by one.
- for each "matter" I want to create a function that takes in the matter and add one into the matter if we click the button.
- The matter should be displayed as a Icon and if we hover over we get a text explaining what the icon stands for./or we take in the name under the icon possibly.
- I need to display each days tasks in a timeframe, but also all timeframes for each task in one box.

### Weekly Statistics.

- Basically we'll save all the days in one page, where we can display the total sum of the week and the each day total also.
