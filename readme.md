#The purpose of this application

- Visitor Tracking: Count and record the number of visitors and the nature of their assistance requests, such as guidance, information, tourism-related inquiries, and more.

- Comprehensive Display: Present a separate page that displays the cumulative statistics of different types of visitor assistance. This includes the total count of each assistance category, allowing for a quick overview of the overall service provided.

- Time Slot Tracking: Implement a feature to log the timing and duration of customer service interactions using time slots. The application will categorize the service interactions into specific time intervals, such as 8:00-9:00, 10:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00, and so on. This functionality enables precise tracking and analysis of service trends over time, including the specific time slots during which services were rendered.

- User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use, particularly for new employees. This approach enhances their onboarding experience and contributes to overall time efficiency.
